# realtime-chat
A realtime TCP chat server and client. Uses a redis backend.

## Instructions
To start a server, simply run `make server` in the terminal.
To start a client, run `make client` in the terminal.

## To-Do 
- Add Chat Rooms
- Migrate to Websockets

## Notes
- Make sure you have redis running on your machine. I use `brew services start redis` on my Mac, but you may need to do something different.
